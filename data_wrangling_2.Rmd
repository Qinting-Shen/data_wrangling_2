## Strings and Manipulations

```{r}
string_vec = c("my", "name", "is", "jeff")

str_detect(string_vec, "jeff")
str_detect(string_vec, "Jeff")
str_detect(string_vec, "e")

str_replace(string_vec, "jeff", "Jeff")
```


```{r}
string_vec = c(
  "i think we all rule for participating",
  "i think i have been caught",
  "i think this will be quite fun actually",
  "it will be fun, i think"
  )

str_detect(string_vec, "i think")
str_detect(string_vec, "^i think") # in the beginning of the sentence
str_detect(string_vec, "i think$") # at the end of the sentence
```


```{r}
string_vec = c(
  "Time for a Pumpkin Spice Latte!",
  "went to the #pumpkinpatch last weekend",
  "Pumpkin Pie is obviously the best pie",
  "SMASHING PUMPKINS -- LIVE IN CONCERT!!"
  )

str_detect(string_vec,"[Pp]umpkin") # with uppercase or lowercase p
```


```{r}
string_vec = c(
  '7th inning stretch',
  '1st half soon to begin. Texas won the toss.',
  'she is 5 feet 4 inches tall',
  '3AM - cant sleep :('
  )

str_detect(string_vec, "[0-9]")
str_detect(string_vec, "^[0-9]")
str_detect(string_vec, "^[0-9][a-z]") # 0-9 and a-z at the beginning
str_detect(string_vec, "^[0-9][a-zA-Z]") # 0-9 and a-z/A-Z at the beginning
```


```{r}
string_vec = c(
  'Its 7:11 in the evening',
  'want to go to 7-11?',
  'my flight is AA711',
  'NetBios: scanning ip 203.167.114.66'
  )

str_detect(string_vec, "7.11") # The character . matches anything.
```

```{r}
string_vec = c(
  'The CI is [2, 5]',
  ':-]',
  ':-[',
  'I found the answer on pages [6-7]'
  )

str_detect(string_vec, "\\[")
str_detect(string_vec, "\\[[0-9]")

# Some characters are “special”. These include [ and ], ( and ), and .. If you want to search for these, you have to indicate they’re special using \. Unfortunately, \ is also special, so you have to add one more \.
